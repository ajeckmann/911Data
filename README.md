This project analyzes 911 response data from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, from 2016 until 2019, inclusive. I worked and volunteered in the EMS world from 2005-2012, so this data is of particular interest to me.

The list of possibilities for analysis with this dataset is limitless. I decided to choose pointers that I felt would allow for good data-driven operational decisions such as:

    -Prioritizing subject matter for training drills
    -Geographical areas to place personnel
    -When to see about allowing for additional staffing--or partnering with additional resource agencies.
    -Predicting likelihood of an increase in call count of certain nature over a given year, a given month,       or a given day of the week
    


THE FOLLOWING WILL BE EXPLORED:

-Trend of Call Count Per Year From 2016-2019 (TOTAL, EMS, FIRE, TRAFFIC)

-Most Prevalent Call Categories Overall (most relevant for EMS)

-Most Prevalent Call Categories in Particular Townships (most relevant for EMS)

-Average Daily Call Count By Month Over the Course of a Year (FIRE, EMS, TRAFFIC)

-The Average Number Of Daily Calls By Month Over The Course OF A Year (EMS, FIRE, TRAFFIC)

    - In other words, was a month consistently correlated with higher or lower daily call count?
    - An example might be: Did Traffic incidents increase in the winter months due to bad weather?
    
-Townships With Highest Call Volume (EMS, FIRE, TRAFFIC)

-Average Hourly Call Count Based on the Hour of the Day (All calls, EMS, FIRE, TRAFFIC)

-Average Hourly Call Count Based on the Day of the Week (All calls, EMS, FIRE, TRAFFIC)

-Correlation between Day or hour of week and Specific call type (most relevant for EMS)

  -For instance:
  
    -Were there were more FALL-related EMS calls during a particular hour of the week? (between 8-9 am on a 
     Sunday?)
    -Were there more OVERDOSE-related calls on Saturdays?
    
-Most prevalent secondary call types in each jurisdiction (most relevant for EMS)
